## Overview

This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) outlines the procedures and strategies for recovering the IndoWater Prepaid Water Meter Management System in the event of a disaster or system failure. The plan ensures business continuity and minimizes downtime.

### Scope
This plan covers:
- Database recovery
- Application server recovery
- Redis cache recovery
- File system recovery
- Network and infrastructure recovery

### Assumptions
- Regular backups are performed according to the backup strategy
- Backup files are stored in multiple locations (local and cloud)
- Alternative infrastructure is available for recovery
- Key personnel are available and trained

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Critical Systems**: 4 hours
- **Non-Critical Systems**: 24 hours
- **Full System Recovery**: 48 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Database**: 1 hour (maximum data loss)
- **Application Files**: 24 hours
- **Configuration**: 24 hours

### Service Level Targets
- **Database Availability**: 99.9%
- **Application Availability**: 99.5%
- **Data Integrity**: 100%

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Server Failure
**Impact**: Complete loss of database functionality
**Probability**: Medium
**Recovery Priority**: Critical

### Scenario 2: Application Server Failure
**Impact**: Web application and API unavailable
