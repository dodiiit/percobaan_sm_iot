## Bundle Size Optimization

The following optimizations have been implemented to reduce bundle size:

- **Vendor Chunk Splitting**: Large dependencies are split into separate chunks to improve caching and reduce initial load time.
- **Terser Minification**: Advanced minification with Terser to reduce JavaScript file sizes.
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is eliminated during the build process.
- **Compression**: Both Gzip and Brotli compression are applied to static assets.
- **Source Map Control**: Source maps are only generated in development mode, not in production.

Configuration can be found in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
build: {
  outDir: 'dist',
  sourcemap: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  minify: 'terser',
  terserOptions: {
    compress: {
      drop_console: true,
      drop_debugger: true,
    },
  },
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        'react-vendor': ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
        'mui-vendor': ['@mui/material', '@mui/icons-material', '@emotion/react', '@emotion/styled'],
        'chart-vendor': ['chart.js', 'react-chartjs-2'],
        'form-vendor': ['formik', 'yup'],
        'i18n-vendor': ['i18next', 'react-i18next', 'i18next-browser-languagedetector', 'i18next-http-backend'],
      },
      chunkFileNames: 'assets/js/[name]-[hash].js',
      entryFileNames: 'assets/js/[name]-[hash].js',
      assetFileNames: 'assets/[ext]/[name]-[hash].[ext]',
    },
  },
}
```

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Code splitting and lazy loading have been implemented to reduce the initial bundle size and improve application load time:

- **React.lazy()**: All route components are loaded lazily using React.lazy() and Suspense.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Components are imported dynamically when needed.
- **Route-based Splitting**: Each route loads its own code chunk.

Example implementation in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { CircularProgress } from '@mui/material';

// Loading Component
const LoadingFallback = () => (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', height: '100vh' }}>
    <CircularProgress />
  </div>
);

// Lazy-loaded components
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));

// Usage in routes
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    {/* Other routes */}
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring has been implemented to track and analyze application performance:

- **Web Vitals**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are tracked and reported.
- **Performance Observer**: Long tasks, layout shifts, and other performance metrics are monitored.
- **Custom Performance Marks**: Key application events are marked and measured.

The implementation can be found in `src/utils/performance.ts`.

Usage in application:

```typescript
// Initialize performance monitoring
initPerformanceMonitoring();

// Mark performance events
performance.mark('app_init_start');
// ... application code ...
performance.mark('app_init_end');
performance.measure('app_initialization', 'app_init_start', 'app_init_end');

// Report web vitals
reportWebVitals((metric) => {
  console.info(`Web Vital: ${metric.name} - ${metric.value}`);
});
```

## Image and Asset Optimization

Images and assets are optimized to reduce file size and improve loading performance:

- **WebP Conversion**: Images are converted to WebP format for better compression.
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple sizes of images are generated for different screen sizes.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they enter the viewport.
- **SVG Optimization**: SVGs are optimized to remove unnecessary metadata.

The implementation includes:

1. **Image Optimization Script**: `scripts/optimize-images.js` - Processes and optimizes all images.
2. **Image Optimizer Utility**: `src/utils/imageOptimizer.ts` - Provides utilities for optimized image loading.
3. **Optimized Image Component**: `src/components/common/OptimizedImage.tsx` - React component for optimized image rendering.

Usage:

```typescript
import OptimizedImage from './components/common/OptimizedImage';

// In your component
<OptimizedImage 
  src="/path/to/image.jpg" 
  alt="Description" 
  width={800} 
  height={600} 
  loading="lazy" 
/>
```

## Nginx Configuration

The Nginx configuration has been optimized for production:

- **Compression**: Both Gzip and Brotli compression are enabled.
- **Caching**: Appropriate cache headers are set for different types of assets.
- **Pre-compressed Assets**: Pre-compressed versions of assets are served when available.
- **Security Headers**: Various security headers are added to protect the application.

Key features in `nginx/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
# Compression - Gzip and Brotli
gzip on;
gzip_comp_level 6;
brotli on;
brotli_comp_level 6;

# Cache control for static assets
location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
  gzip_static on;
  brotli_static on;
}

# Security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

## Docker Optimizations

The Docker configuration has been optimized for production:

- **Multi-stage Build**: Reduces final image size by using a build stage and a production stage.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Only production dependencies are included in the final image.
- **Asset Compression**: Static assets are compressed during the build process.
- **Security Enhancements**: The image runs with minimal permissions and includes security headers.

Key features in `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Install dependencies and build
RUN npm ci --production=false && npm cache clean --force
RUN npm run build:prod

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build output and compress
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
RUN find /usr/share/nginx/html -type f -regex ".*\.\(js\|css\|svg\|json\)$" -exec brotli -f {} \;
RUN find /usr/share/nginx/html -type f -regex ".*\.\(js\|css\|svg\|json\)$" -exec gzip -f -k {} \;
```

## Security Enhancements

Several security enhancements have been implemented:

- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts which resources can be loaded.
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.
- **Permissions Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used.

These security headers are added in both the Nginx configuration and the Dockerfile.

## Usage

To build the application with all optimizations:

```bash
# Development build
npm run build

# Production build with all optimizations
npm run build:prod

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Optimize images only
npm run optimize:images
```

## Monitoring and Testing

After deployment, monitor the application performance using:

1. **Browser DevTools**: Check network, performance, and memory tabs.
2. **Lighthouse**: Run Lighthouse audits to measure performance, accessibility, and best practices.
3. **Web Vitals**: Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console or your analytics platform.
4. **User Metrics**: Analyze real user metrics collected by the performance monitoring implementation.
