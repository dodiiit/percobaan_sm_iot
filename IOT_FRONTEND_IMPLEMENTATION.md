### Real-time Communication

The system uses a hybrid approach for real-time communication:

1. **WebSocket Subscriptions**: Primary method for real-time updates
2. **Polling Fallback**: Automatic fallback when WebSocket is unavailable
3. **Connection Management**: Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading
All IoT components are lazy-loaded to improve initial page load performance.

### 2. Efficient Re-rendering
Components use React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 3. Data Caching
Real-time service implements intelligent caching to reduce API calls.

### 4. Connection Pooling
WebSocket connections are pooled and reused across components.

### 5. Chart Optimization
Chart.js is configured with performance optimizations for real-time data.

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
All IoT endpoints require proper authentication tokens.

### 2. Role-based Access
IoT features are restricted based on user roles (Client, Superadmin).

### 3. Command Validation
All device commands are validated before execution.

### 4. Secure WebSocket
WebSocket connections use secure protocols (WSS) in production.

## Mobile Responsiveness

All IoT components are fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop (1920x1080+)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Mobile (375x667)

### Mobile-specific Features
- Touch-friendly controls
- Swipe gestures for charts
- Optimized layouts for small screens
- Progressive disclosure of information

## Error Handling

### 1. Connection Errors
